    Title: Updated AT max steps
    Author: frank_the_tank, jjos
    Comments-URI: [Increase max steps for ATs](https://github.com/burst-apps-team/burstcoin/commit/123e26a3ded62f184f70f2d40e18ea5fd8b938f1#diff-de81aa4fb23d09bcc765945ed2d84d7bc10d76925338e98c2a48c77da8c8cc4d)
    Status: Draft
    Type: Enhancement (Hard Fork)
    Created: 2021-03-25

## Motivation

Burst smart contracts became much more useful with [CIP-20](cip-0020.md) but still the maximum number of steps a contract is allowed to run in a single block can be low for more complex applications.
This is a simple proposal increasing the maximum number of steps a contract can run in a single block to `1'000'000`.

This is a ten fold increase wen compared to the current value and the impact on nodes should be mininum for any modern computer.
For many cases this will be even benefical for the network. Since allowing contracts to finish their running tasks in the same block reduces the amount of information that needs to be stored permanently on the blockchain.
It should also be stressed that a fee is paid for every single step a contract runs.

## Specification

In the next hard-for event, use the following code:
```java
    public long maxSteps(int height) {
        if(Burst.getFluxCapacitor().getValue(FluxValues.NEXT_FORK, height)) {
            return 1_000_000L;
        }
        return MAX_STEPS.get(atVersion(height));
    }
```

## Compatibility

The change will require a hard-fork.
All ATs running after the fork will be limited by the new maximum number of steps.
